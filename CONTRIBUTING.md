## Build and run from source

This project was bootstrapped with [Electron React Boilerplate (ERB)](https://electron-react-boilerplate.js.org). To understand the project structure and electron specific things, checking out [ERB's documentation](https://electron-react-boilerplate.js.org/docs/installation) might be a good place to start.

This is my first electron project and I am sure this boilerplate might have some bloat stuff that Twester doesn't use.
Please feel free to make a PR to remove them.

**If you have installation or compilation issues with this project, please see [ERB's debugging guide](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/400)**.

Clone the repo via git and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/twesterapp/twester.git
